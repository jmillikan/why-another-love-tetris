# Why Another Love Tetris?

This is a simple single-file tetris game using [love](https://love2d.org). It has only a single game mode and drop rate, and it employs some sort of bogo-rotate. It was written as a first love and lua exercise, and quality of code is uncertain.

## Running

To run, install love and follow the [getting started](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started) instructions for a folder.
